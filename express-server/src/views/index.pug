        | Under SEC Regulation 17g-7, Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
        | Organizations (NRSRSOs) are required to report their historical rating
        | assignments, upgrades, downgrades and withdrawals since 2010. The files
        | must be updated monthly, formatted in XBRL and posted to each rating
        | agency's website. Rating data are generally reported on a one year
        | delay.
        p
          | Because most researchers are unfamiliar with XBRL and cannot easily
          | locate the history files, this valuable resource has seen limited use.
          | On this web page, we provide histories from multiple agencies
          | converted to CSV format - which may be directly loaded into Microsoft
          | Excel or Access.
